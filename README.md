DevSecOps : Netflix Clone CI-CD with Monitoring | Email

"I've successfully deployed a Netflix clone using Jenkins for CI/CD. The application is running on Docker containers managed by a Kubernetes cluster. Security is ensured through tools like SonarQube, Trivy, and OWASP. Monitoring of Jenkins and Kubernetes metrics is achieved using Grafana, Prometheus, and Node Exporter.
